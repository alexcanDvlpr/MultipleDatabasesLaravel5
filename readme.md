## Multiple Databases Laravel 5

This is my first Laravel project in PHP. Is a example of how we can to connect our application to many databases. We have to use:

- [PHP](http://php.net/manual/es/intro-whatis.php).
- [Server like Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html), [Mampp](https://www.mamp.info/en/) or [Laragon](https://laragon.org/)
- A base project of [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel).
- And minimum two databases in MySQL, PostgreSql etc...
